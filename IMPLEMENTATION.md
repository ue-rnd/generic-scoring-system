## üîê Security Features

1. **Unique Tokens**: 64-character random tokens for each judge and public viewing
2. **No Authentication Required**: Judges use token links directly
3. **Token Regeneration**: Invalidate old links and generate new ones
4. **Event-Specific Access**: Tokens tied to specific events
5. **Status Tracking**: Monitor judge acceptance and participation

## üìä Scoring Logic

### Criteria-Based (Pageant):
```
Final Score = Œ£(average_score_per_criteria √ó weight) / total_weight
```

### Rounds-Based (Quiz Bee):

**Manual Mode:**
```
Final Score = Œ£(scores_per_round)
```

**Boolean Mode:**
```
Round Score = correct_count √ó points_per_question
Final Score = Œ£(round_scores)
```

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Test Links Before Event**: Verify all judge links work

4. **Name Judges**: Use descriptive names for easy tracking
5. **QR Codes**: Print QR codes for in-person events
6. **Monitor Progress**: Check completion regularly
7. **Regenerate Carefully**: Old tokens become invalid
8. **Mobile Test**: Test on actual devices before event
