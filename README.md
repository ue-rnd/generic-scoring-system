- **PublicViewController**: Public viewing with configurable visibility

## Scoring Logic

### Criteria-based Events (Pageants)
```
Final Score = Œ£(average_score_per_criteria √ó weight) / total_weight
```
- Each criterion has a weight and max score
- Scores are averaged across all judges per criterion
- Final score is the weighted average

### Rounds-based Events (Quiz Bees)

**Manual Mode:**
```
Final Score = Œ£(scores_per_round)
```
- Judges enter scores directly
- Final score is the sum of all rounds

**Boolean Mode:**
```
Round Score = correct_count √ó points_per_question
Final Score = Œ£(round_scores)
```
- Judges mark correct/incorrect
- Points automatically calculated
- Final score is the sum of all rounds

## üîê Security Features

- **64-character cryptographically secure tokens**
- **Unique constraints** in database prevent duplicates
- **Token regeneration** capability for security
- **No password management** needed for judges
- **Server-side validation** on all score submissions
- **CSRF protection** on all forms
- **Event-specific access** isolation
