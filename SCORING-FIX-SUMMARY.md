# Scoring System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Critical Bug: Judge ID Mismatch**
**Problem:** The `TokenScoringController` was storing `EventJudge` IDs in the `judge_id` column of the `scores` table, but the `Score` model's `judge_id` foreign key references the `judges` table, not `event_judges`.

**Solution:**
- Created migration `2025_10_21_153636_add_event_judge_id_to_scores_table.php`
- Added `event_judge_id` column to scores table
- Made `judge_id` nullable (scores can come from authenticated judges OR token-based event judges)
- Updated `Score` model to include `event_judge_id` in fillable and added `eventJudge()` relationship
- Updated `TokenScoringController` to use `event_judge_id` instead of `judge_id` in all queries

### 2. **UI Inconsistency: Plain HTML vs Filament Components**
**Problem:** Scoring pages (`judge.blade.php` and `results.blade.php`) used plain Tailwind CSS classes and standard HTML, creating visual inconsistency with the admin panel.

**Solution:**
- Refactored both views to use Filament blade components:
  - `x-filament::section` for content containers
  - `x-filament::button` for action buttons
  - `x-filament::badge` for status indicators
  - `x-filament::icon` for icons
  - `x-filament::input` and `x-filament::input.wrapper` for form inputs
  - `x-filament::input.checkbox` for boolean scoring
- Added `@filamentStyles` and `@filamentScripts` directives
- Maintained inline CSS for layouts (avoiding Tailwind grid classes per TAILWIND-GUIDE.md)
- Kept `@vite` directives for custom styles

## Files Modified

### Migrations
1. **database/migrations/2025_10_21_153636_add_event_judge_id_to_scores_table.php**
   - Added `event_judge_id` foreign key column
   - Made `judge_id` nullable

### Models
2. **app/Models/Score.php**
   - Added `event_judge_id` to fillable array
   - Added `eventJudge()` relationship method

### Controllers
3. **app/Http/Controllers/TokenScoringController.php**
   - Changed all `judge_id` references to `event_judge_id`
   - Updated queries in:
     - `showScoringInterface()` - loading existing scores
     - `store()` - saving new scores
     - `getScores()` - AJAX endpoint

### Views
4. **resources/views/scoring/judge.blade.php**
   - Complete refactor using Filament components
   - Improved visual hierarchy with icons and badges
   - Maintained all scoring modes (criteria-based, round-based boolean, round-based manual)
   - Added hover states for better UX

5. **resources/views/scoring/results.blade.php**
   - Refactored to use Filament components
   - Enhanced visual presentation of rankings with emoji medals
   - Color-coded progress bars (green=100%, yellow=50%+, red=<50%)
   - Improved judge progress summary cards

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE scores ADD COLUMN event_judge_id INTEGER NULL;
ALTER TABLE scores ADD FOREIGN KEY (event_judge_id) REFERENCES event_judges(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### Key Model Changes
```php
// Score.php
protected $fillable = [
    'event_id',
    'contestant_id',
    'judge_id',        // Now nullable - for authenticated judges
    'event_judge_id',  // NEW - for token-based scoring
    'criteria_id',
    'round_id',
    'score',
    'is_correct',
    'comments',
];

public function eventJudge(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this->belongsTo(EventJudge::class);
}
```

### Controller Logic Changes
```php
// Before (INCORRECT)
$data = [
    'event_id' => $event->id,
    'contestant_id' => $scoreData['contestant_id'],
    'judge_id' => $eventJudge->id,  // ❌ EventJudge ID in judge_id column
    'criteria_id' => $scoreData['criteria_id'] ?? null,
    'round_id' => $scoreData['round_id'] ?? null,
];

// After (CORRECT)
$data = [
    'event_id' => $event->id,
    'contestant_id' => $scoreData['contestant_id'],
    'event_judge_id' => $eventJudge->id,  // ✅ EventJudge ID in event_judge_id column
    'criteria_id' => $scoreData['criteria_id'] ?? null,
    'round_id' => $scoreData['round_id'] ?? null,
];
```

## Testing

### Test URL Format
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/score/{judge_token}
```

### Sample Token Generation
```bash
php artisan tinker
```
```php
// Get first EventJudge token
\App\Models\EventJudge::first()->judge_token;

// Generate tokens for records without them
\App\Models\EventJudge::whereNull('judge_token')->get()->each(function($ej) {
    $ej->update(['judge_token' => bin2hex(random_bytes(32))]);
});
```

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Migration runs successfully
2. ✅ EventJudge tokens are generated
3. ✅ Scoring interface loads with Filament styling
4. ✅ Scores can be submitted
5. ✅ Scores are saved with correct `event_judge_id`
6. ✅ Results page displays correctly
7. ✅ No judge_id/event_judge_id conflicts

## Impact

### Before
- ❌ Scores were not properly associated with EventJudge records
- ❌ Potential data integrity issues with foreign key references
- ❌ Visual inconsistency between admin panel and scoring pages
- ❌ Plain HTML forms without component reusability

### After
- ✅ Scores correctly reference EventJudge records via `event_judge_id`
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships maintained
- ✅ Consistent Filament UI across all pages
- ✅ Component-based views for better maintainability
- ✅ Enhanced UX with icons, badges, and visual feedback
