## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Migrations fail
**Solution:**
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
# Warning: This will delete all data!
```

### Issue: Tokens not generating
**Solution:** Check if Event model boot() method is being called. Try:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### Issue: QR codes not showing
**Solution:** Check internet connection (uses external API)

### Issue: Real-time updates not working
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the route `/public/event/{token}/live` is accessible
- Ensure event is marked as "Active"

### Issue: Clipboard copy not working
**Solution:** 
- Must use HTTPS (clipboard API requirement)
- Or test on localhost

### Issue: 404 on admin pages
**Solution:**
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan filament:optimize
```
