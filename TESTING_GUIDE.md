SELECT * FROM scores WHERE criteria_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Quiz bee scores: have round_id, question_number, no judge_id
SELECT * FROM scores WHERE question_number IS NOT NULL;

-- Unique constraint for quiz bee
-- Should prevent duplicate (event_id, contestant_id, round_id, question_number)

-- Verify scores are isolated between events
SELECT event_id, COUNT(*) FROM scores GROUP BY event_id;
```

### Test 3.3: Public Viewing for Both Types

**Objective**: Ensure public page adapts to event type

**Steps**:
