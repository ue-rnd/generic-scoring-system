# Views Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully recreated all missing views for the Generic Scoring System with support for both **pageant-style** (criteria-based) and **quiz-bee-style** (rounds-based) events.

## Project Structure (Non-Filament Admin Routes)

Since the project has been reorganized to not use Filament's default admin prefix, all public-facing views use custom routes:

### Route Structure
```
/score/{token}              â†’ Judge scoring interface (pageant)
/admin/score/{token}        â†’ Admin scoring interface (quiz bee)
/public/event/{token}       â†’ Public scoreboard
```

## Event Types and Workflows

### Pageant-Style Events (Criteria-Based)

**Setup:**
1. Create event with `judging_type = 'criteria'`
2. Add contestants
3. Add criteria (with weights, min/max scores)
4. Invite judges (generates unique tokens)

**Judge Workflow:**
1. Receives unique link: `/score/{judge_token}`
2. Sees all contestants with all criteria
3. Enters scores for each contestant-criterion pair
4. Can add comments
5. Submits scores
6. Can view results at `/score/{judge_token}/results`

**Public View:**
- Access via `/public/event/{public_viewing_token}`
- Shows weighted average scores
- Configurable visibility options

---

### Quiz Bee Events (Rounds-Based)

**Setup:**
1. Create event with `judging_type = 'rounds'`
2. Add contestants
3. Add rounds (with question count, points per question)
4. Choose scoring mode: boolean or manual

**Admin Workflow:**
1. Access admin interface: `/admin/score/{admin_token}`
2. See spreadsheet-style grid
3. Mark answers correct/incorrect OR enter scores
4. Real-time calculation of totals
5. Auto-save or manual save

**Public View:**
- Access via `/public/event/{public_viewing_token}`
- Shows cumulative scores per round
- Real-time updates

**No Individual Judge Tokens:**
- Quiz bee uses centralized admin scoring
- Judge tokens redirect to admin interface info page

---

## Styling and Responsiveness

**Framework:** Tailwind CSS v3+

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary: `primary-600` (customizable)
- Success: `green-600`
- Warning: `yellow-500`
- Danger: `red-600`

**Dark Mode:** Full support via Tailwind's dark mode classes

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile-first design
- `sm:` 640px
- `md:` 768px
- `lg:` 1024px
- `xl:` 1280px

**Key UI Patterns:**
- Cards with shadows for content sections
- Sticky elements for navigation and totals
- Progress bars for completion tracking
- Color-coded status indicators
- Animated loading states
- Modal-like expandable sections

    â†’ Returns detailed breakdown for one contestant

## Security Considerations

### Token-Based Access
- All public views use cryptographically secure tokens (64 chars)
- Tokens auto-generated on event creation
- No authentication required for viewing
- Prevents enumeration attacks

### Judge Isolation (Pageant)
- Each judge has unique token
- Can only see/edit their own scores
- Cannot see other judges' scores (configurable in public view)

### Admin Access (Quiz Bee)
- Single admin token per event
- Full control over all contestant scores
- Should be kept confidential

### CSRF Protection
- All POST forms include `@csrf` token
- Laravel automatically validates

---

## Configuration Options

### Public Viewing Config (per Event)

Stored in `events.public_viewing_config` JSON column:

```json
{
    "show_rankings": true,
    "show_scores": false,
    "show_judge_names": false,
    "show_individual_scores": false,
    "show_criteria_breakdown": false,
    "show_round_breakdown": false,
    "show_judge_progress": true
}
```

**Access in views:**
```php
$event->canShowPublic('show_rankings')
```
